  Wild nights - Wild nights!: 'Were I with thee

    Wild nights should be

    Our luxury!


    Futile - the winds -

    To a Heart in port -

    Done with the Compass -

    Done with the Chart!


    Rowing in Eden -

    Ah - the Sea!

    Might I but moor - tonight -

    In thee!'

  ' Poem For My Best Friend': 'Your life is but a piece of cheese,

    drifting on an ocean breeze.

    And you shall cross the seven seas

    until you come upon some trees.

    In which there live a million bees,

    who attack you with their knobbly knees.

    And though you yell ''please, stop it, please!''

    they refuse and then they try to seize

    your shiny, metal, golden keys

    and your favourite pictures of John Cleese,

    with much precision and startling ease,

    and dunk them in a variety of teas.'

  The Sea Shell: "I have hidden inside a sea shell\nbut forgotten in which.\n\nNow\
    \ daily I dive,\nfiltering the sea through my fingers,\nto find myself.\nSometimes\
    \ I think\na giant fish has swallowed me.\nLooking for it everywhere I want to\
    \ make sure\nit will get me completely.\n\nThe sea-bed attracts me, and\nI\u2019\
    m repelled by millions\nof sea shells that all look alike.\nHelp, I am one of\
    \ them.\nIf only I knew, which.\n\nHow often I\u2019ve gone straight up\nto one\
    \ of them, saying: That\u2019s me.\nOnly, when I prised it open\nit was empty.\""
shakespeare:
  Sonnet 116: "Let me not to the marriage of true minds\nAdmit impediments. Love is\
    \ not love\nWhich alters when it alteration finds,\nOr bends with the remover\
    \ to remove:\nO, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,\nThat looks on tempests and is\
    \ never shaken;\nIt is the star to every wandering bark,\nWhose worth\u2019s unknown,\
    \ although his height be taken.\nLove\u2019s not Time\u2019s fool, though rosy\
    \ lips and cheeks\nWithin his bending sickle\u2019s compass come;\nLove alters\
    \ not with his brief hours and weeks,\nBut bears it out even to the edge of doom.\n\
    If this be error and upon me proved,\nI never writ, nor no man ever loved.\",\n\
    \"Sonnet 147\" : \"My love is as a fever longing still,\nFor that which longer\
    \ nurseth the disease;\nFeeding on that which doth preserve the ill,\nThe uncertain\
    \ sickly appetite to please.\nMy reason, the physician to my love,\nAngry that\
    \ his prescriptions are not kept,\nHath left me, and I desperate now approve\n\
    Desire is death, which physic did except.\nPast cure I am, now Reason is past\
    \ care,\nAnd frantic-mad with evermore unrest;\nMy thoughts and my discourse as\
    \ madmen\u2019s are,\nAt random from the truth vainly expressed;\nFor I have sworn\
    \ thee fair, and thought thee bright,\nWho art as black as hell, as dark as night."
  Sonnet 43: 'That time of year thou mayst in me behold

    When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang

    Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,

    Bare ruin''d choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.

    In me thou see''st the twilight of such day

    As after sunset fadeth in the west,

    Which by and by black night doth take away,

    Death''s second self, that seals up all in rest.

    In me thou see''st the glowing of such fire

    That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,

    As the death-bed whereon it must expire,

    Consum''d with that which it was nourish''d by.

    This thou perceiv''st, which makes thy love more strong,

    To love that well which thou must leave ere long.'
wendell berry:
  The Peace of Wild Things: "When despair for the world grows in me\nand I wake in\
    \ the night at the least sound\nin fear of what my life and my children\u2019\
    s lives may be,\nI go and lie down where the wood drake\nrests in his beauty on\
    \ the water, and the great heron feeds.\nI come into the peace of wild things\n\
    who do not tax their lives with forethought\nof grief. I come into the presence\
    \ of still water.\nAnd I feel above me the day-blind stars\nwaiting with their\
    \ light. For a time\nI rest in the grace of the world, and am free."
